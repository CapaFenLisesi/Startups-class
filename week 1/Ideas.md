Why to have a startup and how to generate ideas.  



# Before the class  
1. Ask yourself a question: Why would you want to have a startup? Write it down. After that go to point 2.
2. Watch [How and Why to Start A Startup - Sam Altman & Dustin Moskovitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoqgAy3h4OM&list=PLQ-uHSnFig5MiLRb-l6yiCBGyqfVyVf17) - at least the first 13 minutes. 

# Outline

1. Am I smart enough? 
1. How to come up with ideas
1. What is an idea journal
1. Example

### The Why
What is your motivation? Discuss. 

### Can I change the world? 

Watch the video [Steve Jobs'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) [Vision of the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvEiSa6_EPA)

### Do I just wait for the big idea to come to me? 
I think that if you just sit and wait for the big idea to come to you, it will never come. You have to help yourself a little bit. When you want to be good at something you practice.    

Say you decided that you want to run a marathon. You need to start running a few days a week to **train your muscles** so they can be ready for when the big day comes. The same applies to your brain. You should **train your brain** to come up with ideas every day. 

### Idea Journal
**Ideas are fragile!** We need a place where we can keep all the ideas that come to us, however stupid they may sound initially. 

We care about:
- having access to it at any given time (online, notebook, anything that works for you)

We don't care about: 
- grammar 
- spelling
- structure, etc.

...as long as you capture the important bits: what is the idea about.

Don't worry too much wheather the idea is good or not at this point. We are trying to brainstorm ideas and it means that we don't justify them, we don't decide yet if they are good or bad. We just want to make sure we train our brain muscle for coming up with the ideas.  

### Example


# Homework
1. Set up an idea journal
1. Every day try to come up with one idea
